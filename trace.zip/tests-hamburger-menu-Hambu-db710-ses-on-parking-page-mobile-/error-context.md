      - text: . Cars have been towed and the ticket may cost $180 or more. If you want to park closer there are things you can do to lower your risk. You can drop off any protest signs at 1000 District Ave on Wed, Thu, and Friday. For Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday protests you can drop off signs at the corner of District Ave and Burlington Mall Road. Do not drop off signs if no one is around.
    - paragraph [ref=e18]: Consider Kohl's or the strip mall at the end of District Ave with Just Salad. Unlike Burlington Mall and District Ave, they do not have security patrols and they have not announced they would tow. The strip mall feels safer because it is so busy and any one shop can't tell if you are going into another shop.
    - paragraph [ref=e19]: Burlington Mall and District Ave area have security patrols that look for people exiting a car with a sign or people walking directly from the car to the protest. If you do not carry a visible sign and you walk into Pressed Cafe it would be very difficult for them to identify you as a protestor and identify your car.
    - paragraph [ref=e20]:
      - strong [ref=e21]: You park at your own risk. These strategies do not guarantee that you will not be towed.
