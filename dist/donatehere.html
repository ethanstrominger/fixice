      <h2>Donate Food & Winter Clothes</h2>
      <p>You can help by donating food, winter clothing, and personal hygiene products at the ICE facility during protests, Monday through Friday.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Distribution:</b> Food and clothing are distributed directly to people entering or exiting the ICE facility, including those just released, or given to a local food bank.</li>
        <li><b>Best Days:</b> Wednesday through Friday are ideal, but donations are welcome on Monday and Tuesday as well.</li>
        <li><b>What to Bring:</b> Shelf-stable food (canned items, pasta sauces, oils, spices, gravies), winter clothing, and personal hygiene products. Please bring items in their original packaging. <b>The greatest current needs are tea, coffee, and cooking oil.</b></li>
        <li><b>Updates:</b> Weekly updates about donations are posted on the Justice 4 All page each Thursday and Friday afternoon. Special needs for items are also posted there.</li>
        <li><b>Donate Directly:</b> You can also donate to Toni Matloff via <a href="https://venmo.com/u/Toni-Matloff" target="_blank">Venmo</a> or with cash.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Anyone is welcome to bring shelf-stable donations on Monday or Tuesday. Your support makes a real difference for people in need!</p>
