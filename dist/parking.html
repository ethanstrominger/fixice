    <h1>Tips on Parking for District Ave Protests</h1>
    <p>Click <a href="/public-transportation">here</a> for available public transportation options.
    </p>    
    <p>For current towing risks and safe alternatives see the parking info on this <a
        href="https://bearingwitnessne.org/the-standout">Bearing Witness web page</a>. Parking at the nearby AMC
      theater has been approved for the Wednesday protests - parking there on a holiday is not
      recommended. Cars have been towed in parking lots and on the street along District Ave and at Burlington Mall.
      Tickets may cost $180 or more. If you do get towed, please see Bearing Witness for guidance
      and reporting.</p>
    You can drop off any protest signs at 1000
    District Ave on Wed, Thu, and Friday. For Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday protests
    you can drop your suggestions off on District Ave close to the corner. Do not drop off signs if no one is around.
    </p>
    <p>Burlington Mall and District Ave area have security patrols that look for people exiting
      against towing. There has been comments that if you buy something at a store, you are
      entitled to park there. This is not a guarantee. Security looks for people
      getting out of a car with a sign or people walking directly from the car to the protest.
      If you do not carry a visible sign and you walk into a business it would be very difficult for them
      to identify you as a protestor and identify your car. Although Pressed Cafe would like to guarantee
      that if you park there, security that is identifying cars to tow may not consult with them.
      It is National Development Corp that manages the parking lots.
    </p>
    <p>There is a public parking lot for TRW playground on Stony Brook Road which is often empty and has
      over 30 spots and is 0.8 miles from District Ave.

      for a Google map view.
      Google maps may show a route from Burlington Mall Road, but it is
      not legal to enter Stony Brook Road from Burlington. You can get
      there by setting your navigation to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/HdcKmmQQfaEiMY6d6">28 Stony Brook Rd,
        Burlington, MA</a>.
      TRW Playground is at the end of the road.
    </p>
    <p>You can also consider the strip mall at the end of District Ave with Just Salad
      or the Kohl's parking lot.
      Neither have security patrols and no towing has occurred from there.
      The strip mall feels safer despite the signs because it is so busy.
      If you walk into a business it would be very difficult for you to
      be identified as a protestor. Do not walk directly from your car to the protest.
      On Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday which starts at Burlington Mall Road, you would be able to see if they
      start towing and move your car before they get to it.

    <p style="color:#23408e; font-style:italic; font-size:1.875em;"><strong>The key to minimizing risk is dropping off
        any signs
        that cannot be hidden and going into a business. Do not walk directly from your car to the protest.

    <p><strong><span style="color:#b30000; font-size:1.875em; font-style:italic;">You park at your own risk. These
