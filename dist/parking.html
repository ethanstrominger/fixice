    <h1>Tips on Parking for District Ave Protests</h1>
    <p>For current towing risks and safe alternatives see the parking info on this <a
        href="hhttps://bearingwitnessne.org/the-standout">Bearing Witness web page</a>. Parking at the nearby AMC
      theater has been approved for the Wednesday protests - parking there on a holiday is not
      recommended. Cars have been towed in parking lots and on the street along District Ave.
      Tickets may cost $180 or more. If you do get towed, please see Bearing Witness for guidance
      and reporting.</p>
    You can drop off any protest signs at 1000
    District Ave on Wed, Thu, and Friday. For Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday protests you can drop off signs at
    the corner of District Ave and Burlington Mall Road. Do not drop off signs if no one is around.
    </p>
    <p>Burlington Mall and District Ave area have security patrols that look for people exiting 
      against towing. There has been comments that if you buy something at a store, you are 
      entitled to park there.  This is not a guarantee.  Security looks for people 
      getting out of a car with a sign or people walking directly from the car to the protest.
      If you do not carry a visible sign and you walk into a business it would be very difficult for them
      to identify you as a protestor and identify your car, especially for close by businesses other
      than Burlington Mall and District Ave area.  Although Pressed Cafe would like to guarantee
      that if you park there, security that is identifying cars to tow may not consult with them.  
      It is National Development Corp that manages the parking lots.
    </p>
    <p>Consider the strip mall or Kohl's at the end of District Ave with Just Salad.
      Unlike Burlington Mall and District Ave, they
      do not have security patrols and they have not announced they would tow.
      The strip mall feels safer despite the signs because it is so busy and
      any one shop can't tell if you are going into another shop.

    <p><strong><span style="color:#b30000; font-size:1.25em;">You park at your own risk. These strategies do not
          guarantee that you will not be towed.</span></strong>
