# Guidelnes

Above all, we are committed to nonviolence.

- We protest peacefully.
- We do not antagonize or in any way engage with counter pro-ICE protestors.  Do not use the median near the cross walk.  They get energy from engaging with us and can use these interactions to attract followers.
- We do not block the entrance, approach ICE agents, or block traffic on District Avenue.
- We do not stand in restricted areas as designated by Burlington police.
- We protest systems, not people. Our goal is moral clarity without hostility. Please keep chants firm, clear, and grounded in human dignity.  If an ICE vehicle passes, consider
phrases like "No cages, no cruelty", "You can quit","Do the right thing, quit", "Stop the cruelty/destroying families/breaking the law", or "Show compassion".

# Tips for handling counterprotesters
Counter protestors often try to engage with you starting
with an innocent sounding question, and then trap you in a situation where you get frustrated or confused.  They use interactions for material to attract views, so it is best not to engage.  Here are some strategies

- Move to a different place
- Do not respond to taunts
- If you are being filmed, put a sign up in front of your face
- Look to the side
- Look for a marshal in a bright vest

Please report the incident to a marshal in a bright vest.  

# Photography and Video Recording

Attendees should be aware that Bearing Witness standouts are held in a public space. Photographers and videographers capture images and videos at each standout.

Those uncomfortable with being photographed or recorded may wish to consider other ways to help immigrants. 

## Safety

Marshals in fluorescent vests are scattered throughout the crowd. If you encounter a problem, seek out a marshal.

Medics in blue fluorescent vests are also present. They have water, snacks, hand warmers, and first aid kits.

Before arriving, please consider your own self-preservation (citizenship status) and self-care (sunscreen, hydration, etc.).


# Parking

- For public transportation options, see the [public transportation page](https://fixice.org/public-transportation).
- Parking at the nearby AMC theater is approved for Wednesday protests (not recommended on holidays). Cars have been towed in various lots and on District Ave and at Burlington Mall. Tickets may cost $180 or more. If towed, see Bearing Witness for guidance and reporting.
- The key to minimizing risk: drop off any visible signs, walk into a business, and do not walk directly from your car to the protest.
- You can drop off protest signs at 1000 District Ave on Wed, Thu, and Fri. For Mon, Tue, and Sat protests, drop off signs near the corner of District Ave. Do not drop off signs if no one is around.
- Security patrols look for people exiting cars with signs or walking directly to the protest. If you buy something at a store, you may be entitled to park there, but this is not guaranteed. National Development Corp manages the lots.
- There is a public parking lot for TRW Playground on Stony Brook Road (over 30 spots, 0.8 miles from District Ave). Set navigation to [28 Stony Brook Rd, Burlington, MA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HdcKmmQQfaEiMY6d6). TRW Playground is at the end of the road.
- The strip mall at the end of District Ave (with Just Salad) or the Kohl's lot are also options. Neither have security patrols and no towing has occurred from there. Walk into a business to make it difficult to be identified as a protestor.
- On Mon, Tue, and Sat, protests start at Burlington Mall Road. You can see if towing starts at the strip mall and move your car if needed.
