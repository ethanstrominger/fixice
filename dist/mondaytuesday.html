      <h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
      <p>Above all, we are committed to nonviolence.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We protest peacefully.</li>
        <li>We do not antagonize or engage with counter pro-ICE protestors. Do not use the median near the cross walk. They get energy from engaging with us and can use these interactions to attract followers.</li>
        <li>We do not block the entrance, approach ICE agents, or block traffic on District Avenue.</li>
        <li>We do not stand in restricted areas as designated by Burlington police.</li>
        <li>We protest systems, not people. Our goal is moral clarity without hostility. Please keep chants firm, clear, and grounded in human dignity. If an ICE vehicle passes, consider phrases like "No cages, no cruelty", "You can quit", "Do the right thing, quit", "Stop the cruelty/destroying families/breaking the law", or "Show compassion".</li>

      <h2 id="tips-for-handling-counterprotesters">Tips for Handling Counterprotesters</h2>
      <p>Counter protestors often try to engage with you starting with an innocent sounding question, and then trap you in a situation where you get frustrated or confused. They use interactions for material to attract views, so it is best not to engage. Here are some strategies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Move to a different place</li>
        <li>Do not respond to taunts</li>
        <li>If you are being filmed, put a sign up in front of your face</li>
        <li>Look to the side</li>
        <li>Look for a marshal in a bright vest</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please report the incident to a marshal in a bright vest.</p>

      <h2 id="photography-and-video-recording">Photography and Video Recording</h2>
      <p>Attendees should be aware that Bearing Witness standouts are held in a public space. Photographers and videographers capture images and videos at each standout.</p>
      <p>Those uncomfortable with being photographed or recorded may wish to consider other ways to help immigrants.</p>
