Dear Governor,

I am writing to you as a concerned citizen of Massachusetts. I urge you to take immediate action to address the ongoing issues affecting our community. Your leadership is crucial in ensuring the well-being and prosperity of all residents.

I implore you to take all actions you can to stop the Immigration and Customs Enforcement from operating. Specifically, can you:

	• ENACT EXECUTIVE ORDERS FOR STATE PROPERTY: Issue immediate executive orders to prevent ICE from using state-owned or managed properties, such as courthouses, for staging arrests or detention.

	• TERMINATE xxALL STATE-ICE CONTRACTS: Direct state agencies to terminate existing contracts that provide resources to federal immigration authorities, including 287(g) agreements within the Department of Corrections and the Intergovernmental Service Agreement at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility.

	• RESTRICT AIRPORT ACCESS FURTHER: Move beyond demands and use all legal administrative power to block ICE-chartered deportation flights from state-run airports like Hanscom Field.

	• RESTORE REMOTE COURT PARTICIPATION: Reinstate pandemic-era remote courthouse participation to protect residents from being targeted by ICE during required legal proceedings.

	• CHAMPION CRITICAL LEGISLATION: Publicly and forcefully advocate for the immediate passage of these acts:
		• Safe Communities Act (H.2580 / S.1681) to end state police involvement in civil immigration matters, 
		• Dignity Not Deportations Act (H.1588 / S.1122) to ban local law enforcement from being deputized as ICE agents.

Sincerely,
[NAME]
[TOWN], [STATE]
