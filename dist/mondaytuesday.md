## Guidelines

Above all, we are committed to nonviolence.

- We protest peacefully.
- We do not antagonize or engage with counter pro-ICE protestors. Do not use the median near the cross walk. They get energy from engaging with us and can use these interactions to attract followers.
- We do not block the entrance, approach ICE agents, or block traffic on District Avenue.
- We do not stand in restricted areas as designated by Burlington police.
- We protest systems, not people. Our goal is moral clarity without hostility. Please keep chants firm, clear, and grounded in human dignity. If an ICE vehicle passes, consider phrases like "No cages, no cruelty", "You can quit", "Do the right thing, quit", "Stop the cruelty/destroying families/breaking the law", or "Show compassion".

## Tips for Handling Counterprotesters

Counter protestors often try to engage with you starting with an innocent sounding question, and then trap you in a situation where you get frustrated or confused. They use interactions for material to attract views, so it is best not to engage. Here are some strategies:

- Move to a different place
- Do not respond to taunts
- If you are being filmed, put a sign up in front of your face
- Look to the side
- Look for a marshal in a bright vest

Please report the incident to a marshal in a bright vest.

## Photography and Video Recording

Attendees should be aware that Bearing Witness standouts are held in a public space. Photographers and videographers capture images and videos at each standout.

Those uncomfortable with being photographed or recorded may wish to consider other ways to help immigrants.

## Safety

- Marshals in fluorescent vests are scattered throughout the crowd. If you encounter a problem, seek out a marshal.
- Medics in blue fluorescent vests are also present. They have water, snacks, hand warmers, and first aid kits.
- Before arriving, please consider your own self-preservation (citizenship status) and self-care (sunscreen, hydration, etc.).

## Public transportation

The MBTA bus [route 350](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/350/line) starts at Alewife Station and has stops near to District Ave.

The LRTA bus [route 14](https://lrta.com/routes/route-14/) starts at the Kennedy Center in Lowell and uses the same stops close to District Ave. Some people have reported parking at Wegman's and taking the LRTA route 14 bus to the protest.

## Parking

This section discusses risks of parking at different locations.  The section discusses risks with the perspective of the author (Ethan Strominger).

Tips for reducing risk if you park in a commerciallot:
- do not bring a sign unless you can hide it. Use signs provided by the organizers.  The 
organizers usually have extra, excellent signs.
- if you are bringing your own sign, either hide it or drop it off first. **Wed, Thu, Fri:** You can drop off protest signs at 1000 District Ave on Wed, Thu, and Fri. **Mon, Tue, Sat:** You can drop off  signs near the corner of District Ave and Burlington Mall Road.  Do not drop off signs if no one is around.
- do not get out of the car with visible protest signs
- walk into a business.  Doing this makes it difficult for anyone who is monitoring to 
track you.  It may not make a difference if you buy something - they may not notice and they
mot care
- look around to check for people who may be monitoring.  
- if you are towed, please report it to the organizer of the group.  On the Bearing Witness 
website there are tips for disputing the tow.

I may be a little more adventurous than most on this. If you follow these tips it would be very difficult for someone to track you, so I think you would be safe.  That said, everyone needs to assess their own comfort level.  

Locations to park, with and without permission
- Kohl's - many people do this and have not had issues.  Cars have never been towed from Kohl's.
- Strip mall with Just Salad - I have parked there many times.  Cars have not yet been towed from there, but they did put up new No Parking signs, and someone said there was someone who was trying to monitor cars.  There are many stores which would make it more difficult to track.  You can see the lot from Burlington Mall Road.  Since Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday groups start at Burlington Mall Road, you will be able to see when the tow truck is coming,
and should be able to get to your car before the two truck.  
- Burlington Mall - Several people have been reported being interrogated even when no where 
near there caar.  Many people have parked there.  No towing has yet to occur.
- District Ave - Cars have been towed from this area, even on the street, and it has cost $180 to retrieve your car.  There are one or two security cars, so be extra cautious if there is a security car nearby.  
- TRW Playground: there is a public parking lot for TRW Playground on Stony Brook Road (over 30 spots, 0.8 miles from District Ave). Set navigation to [28 Stony Brook Rd, Burlington, MA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HdcKmmQQfaEiMY6d6). TRW Playground is at the end of the road.  If you set your map
to TRW playground you may be directed to make an illegal turn.
	- [Temple Shalom Emeth, 16 Lexington St, Burlington, MA](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Temple+Shalom+Emeth+16+Lexington+St+Burlington+MA): The temple has given us permission to park there. If you park there, you may want to use Facebook to see if there is shuttling.
	- [United Church of Christ Congregational, 6 Lexington St, Burlington, MA](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=6+Lexington+St+Burlington+MA): The church has given us permission to park there. It is very close to Temple Shalom Emeth. If there is
