    <h1>Boycott Citizens Bank</h1>
    <a href="https://boycottcitizens.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boycottcitizens.org</a> and 
    other organizations are calling for a boycott of Citizens Bank, closing 
    your account, and sending a message to bank executives that profiting from ICE's human rights abuses is unacceptable.
    boycottcitizens.org provides resources for how to close your account and contact the bank, 
    and other companies to boycott.
    </p>
    <p>FixICE.org is working on either finding or creating instructions
      on how to write a letter to bank executives to express your concerns about their involvement with ICE, and how to close your account if you bank with Citizens Bank.
       If you have any resources or suggestions for how to do either of these, please <a
    </p>
