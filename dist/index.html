        FixICE.org is a Burlington, MA-based grassroots organization dedicated to empowering you to help stop ICE cruelties, support immigrant
        rights, and do both
        by winning elections. We provide a curated list of websites and web pages to help you get involved or make
        your current involvement more effective.
        If you want to find an organization to join, the organization list is comprised of
        well established organizations that meet on a regular basis, make it easy to find what you need, and have a
        track record of effective action.
        The Strategy drop down categorizes resources for protests, volunteering, advocacy, or learning.
      </p>
      <p>In the future, the website will categorize by effort (quick, recurring,
        significant effort, and one time) and provide the most
        critical current initiative from the organizations listed.
      </p>

        FixICE.org emphasizes protests at the ICDE detention center in Burlington.  Protests occur Monday through Saturday at the ICE detention center in Burlington, MA. FixICE.org organizes the
        <a href="mondaytuesday">Monday and Tuesday protests</a> from 11–1. Other groups organize
        <a href="protests">Wednesday–Saturday protests</a>. FixICE.org organizes the Monday and Tuesday
        protests.  Each group brings a different perspective, which strengthens
        the
        movement.
