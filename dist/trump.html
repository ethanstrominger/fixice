                    <p>
                        Trump has repeatedly vowed to seek political retribution against his opponents if returned to office, including threats to prosecute political rivals, target critics, and use the Justice Department for personal or political purposes. These statements have raised concerns about the potential for abuse of power and the undermining of democratic norms.

                <p>
                    Trump issued pardons to several wealthy individuals who had donated large sums to his campaign or political committees. Notable examples include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Paul Pogue</strong> – Pogue’s family donated $238,541 to Trump Victory before his pardon for tax fraud. (<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/family-texas-man-trump-pardoned-dished-donations-reelection/story?id=69070481" target="_blank">ABC News</a>)</li>

                        <li><strong>Michael Liberty</strong> – Donated to Trump’s campaign and Republican organizations before his pardon for illegal campaign contributions.

                    </ul>
                    These actions raised concerns about the use of presidential clemency to reward political supporters.

            Trump issued pardons to individuals convicted for their roles in the January 6 Capitol riot. Critics argue this sends a message that political violence is acceptable and will be forgiven if it serves Trump's interests, potentially encouraging future violence.

            Trump’s son <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> and other allies texted or urged Trump’s team to get him to
            tell rioters to stop the January 6 attack, and conservative media figures and Republican officials pushed
            his chief of staff to intervene as the violence unfolded.

        <p>
            Despite about 60+ legal challenges being dismissed for lack of credible evidence, Trump continues to
            publicly assert the 2020 election was fraudulent and “stolen” without proof that has withstood judicial
            scrutiny.

            it amplified false election fraud narratives even as some hosts privately acknowledged those claims were
